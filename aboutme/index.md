&nbsp; 

This is a space where I post my completed and ongoing projects. The
nature of these vary across my interests, which include data science,
hobby electronics, folk music, science and technology. The result is
quite a mixed bag, a smorgasbord of blog posts. This is me learning in
public, a place to track my projects and motivate me to maintain
progress on them, with the added bonus that others (may!) find it a
useful resource or a source of inspiration.

Since 2022 I have been working as a Data Scientist for Morrisons
supermarkets investigating sales and logistics within the supply chain.
Prior to this I was a Material Scientist, having completed a PhD in Physics
at Durham University. After this I was fortunate enough to work in Sweden
for three years as post doctoral researcher.

I now live in Sheffield with the beautiful Peak District on my doorstep.

<!---## Research
In a previous life I worked as a Material Scientist/Physicist. This took to many places
including living in Uppsala, Sweden for 3 years.  at the University of
Sheffield, with a passion for magnetic materials and their applications.

### Magnetoplasmonics and magneto-optics 
In specially designed nanostructured materials, light can
strongly couple to electrons and gets squeezed down to nanoscopic
dimensions. We call this squeezed light a ‘plasmon’. When plasmons are
coupled with magnetism, an external magnetic field can be used to
control the optical properties of a material through enhanced
magneto-optical effects. Magnetoplasmonics combines the fields of
magnetism and plasmonics in the realisation of nanostructured magnetic
surfaces with applications in telecommunications, remote sensing and
optical-control of magnetism. 

### Thin-film, interfacial magnetism and spintronics
Exotic magnetic materials can be created by precisely
layering nanometer thickness metallic films, creating artificial
crystals where interfaces make up a substantial volume of the total
material. These can be used to engineer magnetic properties that
wouldn’t exist in naturally occurring materials. Such materials have
practical significance for the field of spintronics, which aims to
understand how the spin of the electron (which is responsible for
magnetism) can be used to process or store information.

### High entropy alloys
These alloys are concocted to have no single base element,
instead having many elemental components mixed in near equal
proportions. Competing thermodynamic contributions can result in a range
of behaviour, from stablesing simple ordered crystalline phases to the
precipitation of nano-scale grains. Controlling this texture can
influence the magnetic functionality, but finding useful alloy
compositions is challenging due to the complex interactions of the all
the competing elements. To address this, I combine high-throughput
experiments with data-driven material informatics for the design of high
entropy alloys with functional magnetic properties useful for
transformers, inductors, electromagnets and electromagnetic shielding.
